h1. Ahh! There is Life Yet in Ideas

So I've decided to make the jump and start my own gitBlog. I have a few reasons why I am doing this:

# To centralize more of my work around "github":http://github.com
# To keep my blog versioned and always have a backup on hand
# It seems inevitable with a ton of job requirements asking for "github":http://github.com repositories that I might as well show everything on "github":http://github.com sooner rather than later
# I will eventually be posting portfolio and work changes here as well as tips. It would be great to never lose project information and screenshots ever again. ("github":http://github.com has better memory than myself after a few years pass I'm sure)
# I hope that gitBlog's will take of because I would love to watch them
# I'm hopelessly addicted to "github":http://github.com

Now that we have moved the why out of the way let's move on to the how. Obviously I am using git to push to my repository. What may not be obvious is that I will be updating and pushing all of this via my online blog. I know there are a few engines out there to do this, mainly using post commit hooks and starting with a git push itself, but I prefer to take it from the traditional end of pushing the content through my blog administration first. So that's the how.

As to when, well that's a trickier question. I am working on my new blog engine in between paying contracts. As a freelancer, it's always tricky to find the time. As a family man it's even trickier. I'm hoping that having to push this manually will inspire me to keep moving on the engine during any spare moment.

Well I think that's enough for now. I need to start getting my portfolio together and on here soon. Have a goodnight everyone!
