h1. Bartering is but a plugin away?

I started my "Barter project":http://github.com/m3talsmith/barter earlier this year when things started to really going south economically. The idea was to have a public API that people could use or setup themselves that would develop a network where people could barter with each other. It was to be my Sunday project but the time was never there.

So, always being short on time, here's my shortcut. I'm going to start a new branch and make it a plugin for now. That way you can take advantage of bartering right in your application immediately. Think about being able to insert bartering in to your ecommerce application or your social network. I think that would be awesome personally.

I hope to eventually flesh it out to be an engine, but only time will tell. Whatever happens I know that I don't want development on this to stop so I'll do what I can to keep it moving forward.

One other thought before I sign off; speaking in terms of plugins. I have two other plugins on my plate to push up.

# has_git_blog; my gitBlog plugin that I'm developing for this particular blog.
# A yet to be named plugin to incorporate escrow into your app: either using an escrow or becoming an escrow yourself.

Many of my ideas rightfully should be engines, and it looks like edge is becoming engine friendly again, but I won't be releasing engines until I feel I have a good release to pin it too.

That's all for now. As always, cheers and happy coding.
