h1. A Teaching / Learning Experience

h2. How I sum up society in general: Why I support Open Source in General and gitHub specifically

I like to teach things that I am passionate about. I feel a lot of people in my community feel the same way; otherwise we would not have such things as barcamps, conferences, ruby groups or even Open Source anything. Teaching, at least with me, is inseparable from what I do and who I am. I believe that the majority of those in the Open Source movement are the same way so I'm not expecting too much counter argument on this.

Occasionally the wonderment of it all overwhelms me, and I sit and ponder this subject just a little more. Lunch time today was one of those moments and here are some of my thoughts.

h3. Teaching requires learning: teaching teaches

The first thing that I've noted is that teaching requires learning. Without learning you have nothing to teach. In order to keep your teaching relevant you have to keep learning. It's an infinite loop that feeds on itself while spreading itself to others. I can't think of a more beautiful loop having ever been designed.

I have also noticed that while I teach a certain subject I become just as much a student as my students. I may be learning something, or discovering something at a higher level, but I still feel that kinship with the students in one way or another; I am still as excited to learn something new and interesting, and as prone to share that excitement with others, as the students are.

h3. Learning builds community

The kinship the teacher feels with the students has many benefits: most of which are only benefits if they are shared with others. All of those shared benefits bring about community - They either build or draw people to build communities around something they are passionate or excited about; things that are being learned. When communities are built, ideas are tried, experimentations are done, results are used, learned from, and taught. The community is always the prime beneficiary of this and it is self perpetuating.

h3. Communities require openness and honesty

A good community communicates well. They share well. They are open with their results. They are honest about their mistakes. They don't pull any punches.

If any of those things fall through the cracks the community will start to unravel.

If you try to lock down knowledge that was created by others you are withdrawing yourself from that community. If you create hope around something and then don't deliver you instill a distrust towards your motives. If you do not look at your project and not see at least one thing wrong with it at completion your are deluding yourself and reducing your effectiveness in future projects. All of these things cause people to withdraw from you, and thus you are being slowly dropped from the community.

Sometimes things are picked up again at a later point. It is our goal to never let it get to that point.

h3. Leaders rise out of good communities

To help with that goal, leaders rise up. Leaders tend to be those who understand what it takes to have a good community, and how to knit it all together. Leaders eloquently espouse, promote, teach, and follow ideas and ideals that other people also espouse, promote, and learn about. This saves the other people the trouble of having to teach and build themselves, and since a majority of people are at least a little shy of the public stage this works out just fine.

In other words, leaders are a natural and beneficial side effect of a good community.

h3. Learners rise out of good communities in direct support of Leaders

Remember why communities are built, to mutually benefit those who wish to learn and partake in a particular knowledge or path. Right away that screams out the fact that good communities are full of learners. Given the previous point, that leaders also rise out of good communities, that communities grow tighter around leaders, that leaders teach, it is safe to say that learners then rise out of good communities in direct support of the community leaders. There will always be quibbles as to which leader and why, but that only supports the fact more. That is an integral part of a community. Without the support of the learners there would be no teachers and thus no leaders.

h3. Commanders rise out of bad communities

Now for a darker turn for a moment. I want to differentiate Leaders from Commanders. They are not the same. There are plenty of Commanders that will call themselves Leaders, but very few true Leaders will ever call themselves Commanders.

The cause of this comes from most often from bad or fragmented communities. The type of people that hang around bad communities are often the type that are loathe to let something die; they will it to survive no matter how badly it is accepted. As a defense mechanism these people build a command persona around them in order to force people to use knowledge a certain way, or worse off, to withdraw knowledge and command people to use the end product. This bring in greed and other unsavory traits, and we can dwell on this a little later if I have time.

h3. Protectors rise out of bad communities in direct opposition to Commanders

Often times other people in a bad community will get tired of the hoarding or abuses and they will rise up in opposition to the commanders while simultaneously staying in the community they are accustomed to. It is enough to say that these people exist for now, and that they exist because of their opposition to the commander type. This will come in to clearer view when the full properties of the commander are discussed.

h3. Commanders destroy others

Commanders may not mean to destroy others, or they may. They often believe in an "ends justifies the means" kind of mentality, and destruction is the natural course of this action. The path towards this destruction is akin to thus:

# An "evil" to the community is proposed
# Knowledge is constrained
# Freedom of contribution is reduced
# A self canabalism on the community begins, reaching for finances, evangelism, etc
# Heavier evangelism is needed to support the canabalism
# An enemy is created
# The commander declares more strigent control over knowledge and people
# Real enemies arise in the form of resistance (the protectors we spoke of earlier)
# Rinse and repeat until the community is used up, broken apart, or completely brainwashed

The base centralization of knowledge creates a power base that only tightens and increments the amount of centralization exponentially. Commanders induce this to begin with. Thus commanders destroy others and they destroy a community.

h3. Leaders build up others

Leaders lead through teaching. They lead because others find their teaching useful. That builds a person up and keeps a person and a community healthy. This has been mostly discussed earlier but I thought it would do well to set a contrast here against commanders.

Leading requires teaching: otherwise it is just commanding

h3. And then there is the majority that is stuck between them all

Unfortunately, some people are stuck in certain communities. Whether it be for work or because of locality. For better or for worse they are there. The teachers will be the ones who draw them out; make them healthy again. The commanders are the ones who either keep them stuck or make it suck to be stuck just that much more.

h3. Why I support github

I love github because it embodies everything that a good community has. There is a ton of good sharing going on, plenty of openness, learners, teachers, and leaders. It's dynamic and decentralized. It's even free for starters. though it is lacking in certain features (a proper blog/comment setup perhaps?), it provides the 90%+ that most communities need to grow and thrive.

I hope it continues as long as source forge and other such backends have done. I find github much more usable than any other previous offering. Try it out and you'll see what I mean.

That about wraps my thoughts up. I will post this on "The Urban Rebellion":http://blog.theurbanrebellion.com later so that you can comment on this. Here's some final words to let you go with.

h1. &nbsp;

What brings this entire post about is the fact that I have an apprentice. My apprentice is a young man, a senior from high school, who's trying to decide on his specific field of work, is good with computers in general, and has a interest in programming.

I've started teaching him the skill sets of a Basic Web Designer, Senior Lead Developer, Unix Administrator, and Project Manager. I'm using broad strokes a step at a time and he's coming along nicely. Once he was over the initial how's and why's of programming I started a "project":http://github.com/m3talsmith/tasche on "github":http://github.com to help teach him from the ground up. You can visit "LordByron's":http://github.com/LordbyronIII fork "here":http://github.com/LordbyronIII/tasche.

Please, send him a message of encouragement, or pitch in if you are so inclined. He would be thrilled.
