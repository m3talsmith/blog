h1. Let's have some fun

Last night I did a little bit of experimenting, seeing what was capable and what was not through github. For those inclined, you can read through my commits on the README.textile file. For others, here's a quick breakdown.

Last night I was dealing with embedded links to images from your repository. You cannot link to paths of any sort directly in your repository, relative or absolute, and expect it to show up in here. The README parser isn't *that* good. For example, I was trying to link to one of my images found in my footer. And even though I could pull the image up remotely from the repository in the browser, it would not show up via a src attribute. I ended up going with the photo linked in my facebook account.

On a good note, I really liked having an automatic feed of my commits that I could post to my other blog. This will come in handy down the line.

Tonight I have two goals for this experiment:

# Link to an archived article (last nights) from this post;
# Install Google Analytics on this blog.

I will probably not get the latter done as I am horribly feverish and tired today. I will however try the former "now":http://github.com/m3talsmith/blog/tree/master/2008/11/14/

I'll commit and see if that worked. If not I'll just strike out the above ... :) I should really make a development branch for stuff like this.

Cheers!
